### Hi there, I'm Júlio Castro

### Happy to see you here!   
I am a full-stack software engineer and Isabela´s father. I love programming,  and connect with other people united by technology.

As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world. That's why I like to make things that make a difference.
